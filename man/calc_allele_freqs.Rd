\title{Calculate allele frequencies}
\usage{
calc_allele_freqs(human_profiles, rm_markers = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{human_profiles}{Tibble or data frame with alleles for all humans in reference
database including three columns: SampleName, Marker, Allele.}

\item{rm_markers}{A vector indicating what markers should be removed prior to
calculating log10LRs. NULL to include all markers. By default, for the
bistro function AMEL is removed as it is not standard to include it in LR
calculations.}
}
\value{
A tibble where the first column is the STR allele and the following
columns are the frequency of that allele for different markers. Alleles
that do not exist for a given marker are coded as NA.
}
